            At the Queer Digital Front, we believe that technology should empower—not exclude—LGBTQ+ communities. As a nonprofit software foundation, we support and develop open-source technology that makes digital spaces more inclusive, accessible, and safe for queer individuals worldwide.

            We collaborate with open-source projects to build new features, improve accessibility, and strengthen security, ensuring that digital tools reflect and serve the needs of LGBTQ+ users. From privacy-focused communication platforms to tools for tracking anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, we help shape the future of technology by funding, mentoring, and organizing volunteers, developers, and activists who share our mission.
